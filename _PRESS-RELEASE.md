There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

  Compare Politicians on Twitter

## Sub-Heading ##
  Find out if Republicans or Democrates care less about what you care for.
  

## Summary ##
  Use keyword searches on Twitter as indicators which topics are of importance for Republicans and Democrats or which they seem not to care about. 

## Problem ##
  Considering media reports on the most snappy or outragious comments of our beloved Representatives, it is not immediately obvious on how to get a birds eye view on which topics politicans generally tend to care more or less. Twitter is a place politicians send out a large amount of soundbites representing official positions and their own opinions, but it is not trivial to quickly assess which topic is more talked about by Repoublicans or Democrats in general. It is difficult to tell how much a party and their representatives are actually talking about a subject on Twitter.

## Solution ##
  The app gives an easy way to visualize to the enduser how many Democrats vs Republicans voice their opinion or position around a chosen keyword. (without judgement)

## Quote from You ##
  If they are not talking about what you care for, why would you vote for them? 

## How to Get Started ##
  Simply open the app and click on often used keywords or use the search bar to find out if republicans or democrats talk more about your topic of interest. 

## Customer Quote ##
  "Finally I know whom not to vote for. They just don't care about hot air baloons!" -- disillusioned citizen, probably

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  You want to know whom not to vote for. Find out today, use the search bar to see if republicans or democrats care less about your topic of interest.
